# hyprland everforest ðŸŒ²

![showcase](showcase.mp4)

This is the repo with my dotfiles for Hyprland with the Everforest theme. Some comments might be German - because I am German.

The dotfiles should be self explanatory but I need to give credit to a few people I got those from.

1. [Lokesh Krishna](https://github.com/lokesh-krishna/dotfiles) - I used his for my waybar
2. [cenunix](https://github.com/cenunix/dotfiles) - I used his for my animations
3. [This guy](https://gitlab.com/dochi77/arch-rices/-/tree/main/everforest/spicetify/Themes?ref_type=heads) - I used his spicetify theme
4. [prtce](https://github.com/prtce/wofi) - I used this wofi theme and switched out the colors

Additionally:

- my [config](https://github.com/bgrnwd/everforest-kitty) for using everforest in kitty 
- my neovim configuration: [nvchad](https://nvchad.com/)
- my bash prompt: [starship](https://starship.rs/)
- my [cursors](https://github.com/sainnhe/capitaine-cursors)

I need to thank:

1. [Gradience](https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience) for making libadwaita (and gtk theming in general) bearable
2. [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) - this should be self explanatory
